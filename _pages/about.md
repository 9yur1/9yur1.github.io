<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master’s student at Kyung Hee University, researching multimodal AI, with a focus on audio-visual question answering, change captioning, and robust perception under incomplete inputs. I’ve published papers in ECCV, ICASSP, and IEEE Access, and am passionate about building interpretable and real-world applicable AI systems.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
